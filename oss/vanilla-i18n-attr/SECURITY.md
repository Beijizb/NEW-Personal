# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Version `0.1.x` is supported while the project is incubating. Breaking changes
will always increment the minor version.

2. Include:
   - A concise description of the issue.
   - Steps to reproduce or a proof-of-concept (if available).

We prefer private disclosure. After a fix is prepared, we will coordinate a
